# Project 3

Using npm as our package installer.

Started brainstorming the idea for our project.

Created a Trello board, started populating ideas onto there for features.

A basic/starter backend was created, and then shared between the team.

Each team member created their own branch.

Started building the models, db, controllers, and seed files.

Started working on authentication. Creating secure routes that are only valid for registered patients/users/specific people
